            <h3><a href="https://www.charlotte.edu/">UNCC Homepage</a> </h3>
            <p>This is the main website for the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and this will be the site we'll be using as a 
                <b>good</b> example of crap site</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> The site displays good use of contrast as the sites uses a color pallette of green and yellow with white being the color of text which 
                results in the text of the site sticking out and being readible to the average person whilst also having elements that are either big or small based
                upon their importance.</li>
                <li><b>Repitition:</b> The site contains a good use of repitition as it repeats the use of  the same colors for various elements, the font style used, font size based upon importance, and the
                use of rectangular shapes.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> The site contains good alignment through their use of headers with paragraphs establising a good visual connection as it gets readers to read the most important text first 
                with larger font sizes and then elaborates within smaller text with a smaller font size.</li>
                <li><b>Proximnity:</b> Elements on featured on the page that are related to one another are grouped together with another element on the page which can be best seen on the section of the page containing stats with icons represnting 
                    and how it's grouped together with the text describing what they're about.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
            <p>This a Craigslist, it's primarily used for the selling and buying from third party sellers but has many other services availible and this will be the site we'll be using as a 
                <b>bad</b> example of crap site </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> While the site has contarst the unchanged link color mixed with the grey of the site is not easy on the eyes but also alot of the elements on the page is very samey with not much variation.</li>
                <li><b>Repitition:</b> The colors used are all links so they are all purple and while it's repititish it's completely unappealing with the text font sizes being different  with no sense of consistency with no sense of professionalism 
                or well thought organization. </li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> The text allignment featured is vary sparactic varying betweeen left leaning and centered for seemingly no reason and the categories featured on the homepage
                has no sense of being organized based upon the importance of the categories featured.</li>
                <li><b>Proximnity:</b> While the site features elements grouped together there's absoluetly nothing present on the site to set one element from another as they all look the exact with either too little or too much white space depnding on the page.</li>
            </ul>
