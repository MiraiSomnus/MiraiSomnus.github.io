        <h2>Who?</h2>
        <p>The person to whom this site was named after and was created for is Jasmine Greene, a mother of two
            working at the Pharmacy, Omnicare. This site was created with the thought of taking care and making sure 
            the good health of others was maintained and the first step we thought to convey this is by 
            sharing the way to attack common colds through the use of various medicine most of which Jasmine is already
            familiar with thanks to working in a pharamacy.
